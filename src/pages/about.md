Born and raised in South Africa, I moved to Belgium in 2009 to study industrial design. After graduating, I worked as a product designer for a few years before I discovered my passion for software development. Nowadays I aspire to write more about my journey and experiences.

I hope you can find yourself in my stories and that we can connect over our shared experiences.

Wishing you a beautiful cosmic journey through the ever expanding universe.
